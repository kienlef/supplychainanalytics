### Description
This course offers an in-depth overview of supply chain analytics cases to optimize global supply chains. As businesses expand and their supply chain structures grow in complexity, the need for enhanced visibility and decision support becomes imperative. 

Overall, we outline more than 20 high-impact value cases throughout the supply chain, focusing on the overarching process perspective. Analytics demands thorough integration into processes to support data-driven decision-making effectively.

The initial session will break down the four critical components of supply chain management: sourcing, production, planning, and distribution. Subsequent sections will explore how analytics can be integrated into each segment to enhance efficiency and flexibility.

Planning aims to optimize the distribution of resources in line with the capacities throughout the entire supply chain. Analytics can play a crucial role at various stages within the so-called 'supply chain planning matrix,' beginning with sophisticated forecasting and inventory management. We will discover that forecasting demand patterns accurately at strategic, tactical, and operational levels is essential and that fine-tuning inventory levels represents a prime opportunity for applying analytics.

In the sourcing module, analytics are applied to improve supplier selection and performance, ensuring high-quality inputs. By analyzing supplier data, companies can identify risks and opportunities in their supply chain, leading to more informed decision-making.

The making phase utilizes analytics to refine manufacturing processes, from cost reduction to predictive maintenance. This includes using sensors linked to process status information to monitor equipment health, predict failures, and optimize production schedules.

Lastly, the delivery aspect leverages analytics to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline delivery logistics. This involves using real-time tracking and route optimization algorithms to reduce shipping times and costs.

At the end of this lecture, attendees will possess a thorough grasp of the vast array of analytics applications within supply chain management. You will be introduced to fundamental best practices for your analytics journey. This knowledge aims to enable everyone to back data-driven decisions that boost operational efficiency, cut costs, and elevate customer satisfaction.
